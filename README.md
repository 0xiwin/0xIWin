👋 Hello there!

**I usually build AI stuff:**

[💻 AgenticSeek](https://github.com/Fosowl/agenticSeek)
A fully local alternative to Manus AI and other cloud-tied agents.

[🎧 SoundGan](https://github.com/Fosowl/SoundGan)
A full pipeline for training GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to generate audio. from dataset download to training. (kinda broken, will fix)

[🎮 ReinforcementLearningGym](https://github.com/Fosowl/ReinforcementLearningGym)
Solutions to classic OpenAI Gym environments using reinforcement learning.
Watch agents learn to walk one episode at a time. Then get stuck with exploding gradients (I am still a noob with rl).

[🚘 monocularSlam](https://github.com/Fosowl/monocularSlam)
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with monocular camera input.
Real-time 3D world reconstruction from car dashcam footage. Inspired by *Geohot* Twitchslam.

I hope my effort can make a small difference in making AI more community driven.

Open to flying halfway across the planet for conferences (especially if I don't have to pay for the plane).

**Support:**

It still blows my mind that AgenticSeek took off like it did. With that growth comes a lot of new responsibilities, if you’ve found value in AgenticSeek consider buying me a coffee.

*(or a GPU, I need more compute)*
